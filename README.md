# jQuery Sticky Footer
The footer is positioned at the bottom of the page but *without* an `absolute` position.

## Installation
You'll need [bower](http://bower.io/) to install jQuery Sticky Footer plugin and its dependencies.
Install the plugin and save it as a dependency in your project:
```sh
$ bower --save install jquery-sticky-footer
```

## Usage

The page structure has to match the following one:
```html
<body>
    <div>...</div>
    <div class="footer">/div>
</body>
```

- `<body>` tag must have *ONLY* two tags as children: the first one as page container and the second one as footer container.
- There are NO restrictions for tags and classes that you can use as children of the `<body>` tag.

Please run the following script to initialize a footer:
```js
$('.footer').stickyFooter();
```

## Development
The project has the following structure:
```
dist/
*.min.js // The minified and uglified version of the component.
src/
    *.js // The source file
tests/
    ... // Contains all tests and all needed file to set up a tests environment.
    *.test.js // All tests need to have the "test" suffix before the extension.
...
```
